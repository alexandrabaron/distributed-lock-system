## Overview

This project implements a distributed consensus system that allows multiple clients to manage distributed locks in a consistent manner. The system ensures that only one client can own a lock at a time, even in a distributed environment.

### Key Features

- **Leader-Follower Architecture** with automatic replication
- **Strong consistency** of data across all servers
- **Robust synchronization protocol** with ACK and timeouts
- **Advanced error handling** with detailed logging
- **Real-time monitoring** of server status
- **Socket communication** for network connectivity

### Components

- **Leader Server**: Manages all lock operations and synchronizes with followers
- **Follower Servers**: Replicate the leader's map and can respond to read requests
- **Clients**: Connect to any server to perform operations

## Features

### Supported Operations

| Operation | Description | Server |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOCK` | Acquire a distributed lock | Leader only |
| `UNLOCK` | Release a distributed lock | Leader only |
| `OWN` | Check the owner of a lock | All servers |

### Operating Rules

- **LOCK**: Success if lock doesn't exist, failure otherwise
- **UNLOCK**: Success if client owns the lock, failure otherwise
- **OWN**: Returns the owner client ID or "NONE"

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- 3 Ubuntu virtual machines (or physical machines)
- Network connectivity between machines

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the project**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/alexandrabaron/Distributed-Lock-System.git)
   cd distributed-lock-project
   ```

2. **Compile Java files**
   ```bash
   javac Server.java
   javac Client.java
   javac DistributedLockTest.java
   ```

3. **Configure firewall** (on each VM)
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 5000
   ```

## Configuration

### Network Configuration

The system is configured to work with the following IP addresses:

| Server | IP Address | Port | Role |
|---------|------------|------|------|
| Leader | 10.0.2.3 | 5000 | Primary server |
| Follower 1 | 10.0.2.4 | 5000 | Replicated server |
| Follower 2 | 10.0.2.5 | 5000 | Replicated server |

### Configuration Modification

To change IP addresses, modify the `Server.java` file:

```java
private static final Map<String, Integer> SERVER_PORTS = new HashMap<>();
static {
    SERVER_PORTS.put("10.0.2.3", 5000);   // Leader VM
    SERVER_PORTS.put("10.0.2.4", 5000);   // Follower VM 1
    SERVER_PORTS.put("10.0.2.5", 5000);   // Follower VM 2
}
```

## Usage

### Starting Servers

**Important: Start in the following order**

1. **Start the Leader** (VM 10.0.2.3)
   ```bash
   java Server 10.0.2.3 5000 leader
   ```

2. **Wait 5 seconds, then start Follower 1** (VM 10.0.2.4)
   ```bash
   java Server 10.0.2.4 5000 follower
   ```

3. **Wait 5 seconds, then start Follower 2** (VM 10.0.2.5)
   ```bash
   java Server 10.0.2.5 5000 follower
   ```

### Using Clients

**Simple test:**
```bash
java Client <server_ip> <port> <client_id>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Connect to leader
java Client 10.0.2.3 5000 Client1

# Connect to a follower
java Client 10.0.2.4 5000 Client2
```

## Testing

### Automated Test

```bash
java DistributedLockTest
```

This test performs:
- Concurrent lock acquisition
- Consistency verification
- Lock release tests
- Concurrent access simulation

### Manual Test

**Note**: When testing manually with separate client instances, each client completes its test sequence quickly. To observe true concurrency:

**Option 1 - Launch clients simultaneously** (in separate terminals):
```bash
# Terminal 1
java Client 10.0.2.3 5000 Client1

# Terminal 2 (launch at the same time or very quickly)
java Client 10.0.2.4 5000 Client2
```

**Option 2 - Use DistributedLockTest** (recommended for concurrent testing):
```bash
java DistributedLockTest
```
This automatically launches multiple clients in parallel and tests concurrent lock acquisition.

**Understanding the results**:
- Each client will test `lock1` and `lock2` independently
- If both clients try to acquire the same lock simultaneously, only one will succeed (SUCCESS) and the other will fail (FAIL)
- The delays added in Client.java (500ms between operations) allow better observation of concurrent behavior

### Expected Results

```
=== Testing Lock Sequence for lock1 ===
Client Client1 - Owner of lock1: NONE
Client Client1 - TryLock(lock1) Response: SUCCESS
Client Client1 - Owner of lock1: Client1
Client Client1 - TryLock(lock1) Response: FAIL
Client Client1 - TryUnlock(lock1) Response: SUCCESS
Client Client1 - Owner of lock1: NONE
=== End of Test Sequence ===
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant F as Follower
    participant L as Leader
    participant F2 as Other Followers

    Note over C,F: Scenario 1: LOCK/UNLOCK Operation 
    C->>F: LOCK/UNLOCK request
    F->>F: Mark request as pending (keep connection open)
    F->>L: Forward request
    L->>L: Validate & update leader map
    L->>F: SYNC message (to all followers, including the one that forwarded)
    par Synchronous Replication
        F->>L: ACK
        F->>F: Update local map & check pending
        F->>C: SUCCESS response (close connection)
    and Other Followers
        F2->>L: ACK
        F2->>F2: Update local map
    end
    L->>F: SUCCESS response (after all ACKs received)
    alt If FAIL (before SYNC)
        F->>C: FAIL response (close connection)
    end

    Note over C,F: Scenario 2: OWN Operation
    C->>F: OWN request
    F->>F: Check local map directly
    F->>C: Return owner info
```

### Thread Management

- **Thread Pool**: Uses `ExecutorService` to manage connections
- **Thread Safety**: Synchronization with `synchronized` on critical operations
- **Timeout**: Timeout handling to prevent deadlocks

## Communication Protocol

### Client-Server Messages

| Message | Format | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| LOCK | `LOCK,<lockName>,<clientId>` | Acquisition request |
| UNLOCK | `UNLOCK,<lockName>,<clientId>` | Release request |
| OWN | `OWN,<lockName>,<clientId>` | Owner request |

### Inter-Server Messages

| Message | Format | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| SYNC | `SYNC,<command>,<lockName>,<clientId>` | Synchronization |
| REGISTER | `REGISTER,<serverIp>:<port>` | Follower registration |
| ACK | `ACK` | Acknowledgment |

### Responses

| Response | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `SUCCESS` | Operation successful |
| `FAIL` | Operation failed |
| `NONE` | No owner |
| `ERROR` | System error |
| `TIMEOUT` | Network timeout |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Connection refused` | Server not started | Check that servers are running |
| `Port already in use` | Port occupied | `sudo lsof -i :5000` then `sudo kill -9 <PID>` |
| `Timeout` | Network issue | Check connectivity between VMs |
| `Registration failed` | Leader not started | Start leader before followers |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check used ports
sudo lsof -i :5000

# Test connectivity
ping 10.0.2.3
telnet 10.0.2.3 5000

# Check logs
tail -f server.log
```

### Logs and Monitoring

The system displays detailed logs with:
- Incoming connections
- Messages received/sent
- Synchronization operations
- Errors and timeouts
- Server status

## Security

### Considerations

- **Authentication**: Not implemented (can be added)
- **Encryption**: Clear communication (TLS possible)
- **Authorization**: Basic access control by client ID
